# 1X3 Router Verification Testbench (UVM)
### Overview:-
This project implements a Universal Verification Methodology (UVM) based testbench to verify the functionality of a packet-based router module. The router receives a packet from a single source and routes it to one of three destinations based on a 2-bit address in the packet header.
###  Key Features:-
1x3 Routing Capability: Routes incoming data to one of three output channels based on select signals. Comprehensive Verification: A robust testbench is included to validate the router's behavior under various scenarios and conditions.

### Functional Overview:-
The project is implemented using Verilog for the design and SystemVerilog for the verification environment. It utilizes standard verification methodologies (UVM) to ensure thorough testing and coverage of all functional aspects.
### Prerequisities:-
Verilog and SystemVerilog simulation tools. Familiarity with UVM methodology is recommended for understanding the verification environment.
### Contribution:-
Contributions are highly encouraged! Feel free to connect and collaborate if you have any suggestions or improvements. Letâ€™s work together to enhance this project further.
