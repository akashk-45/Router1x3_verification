# 1X3 Router Verification Testbench (UVM)
## Overview:-
This project implements a Universal Verification Methodology (UVM) based testbench to verify the functionality of a packet-based router module. The router receives a packet from a single source and routes it to one of three destinations based on a 2-bit address in the packet header.
##  Key Features:-
1x3 Routing Capability: Routes incoming data to one of three output channels based on select signals. Comprehensive Verification: A robust testbench is included to validate the router's behavior under various scenarios and conditions.
